# protosh
🐚 protosh, or proto shell. This is my own personal shell that I continuously update with features and such. It's completely written in C and supports key features all shell's have in common such as:
 - execution
 - waiting
 - parsing
 - and history! 
 
 I'm constantly adding new features as I go.
